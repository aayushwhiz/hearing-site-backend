The Ford Motor Company held its 3rd Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, led by Executive Director of Investor Relations, Lynn Antipa-Tyson, and featuring key executives including CEO Jim Farley and CFO John Lawler. The call addressed the company's financial performance, challenges, and strategic direction amidst ongoing industry changes, particularly in the electric vehicle (EV) market.

Farley expressed gratitude for the Ford teamâ€™s efforts in reaching a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers, which is expected to help restart operations and bring back over 20,000 employees. He highlighted the company's focus on product strength, particularly in their internal combustion engine (ICE) and hybrid vehicles, while also emphasizing the importance of software and services in their future strategy.

Lawler provided financial insights, noting a mixed quarter impacted by the UAW strike, which resulted in an EBIT impact of approximately $100 million and a reduction of about 80,000 units from production plans. He mentioned that Ford's adjusted EBIT for the quarter was $2.2 billion, with a revenue increase of 11%. However, the company withdrew its full-year EBIT guidance due to uncertainties from the strike and ongoing industry disruptions.

The executives discussed the challenges in the EV market, including pricing pressures and the need for cost reductions. They emphasized the importance of vertical integration and battery technology in achieving competitive pricing and profitability for future EV models. The company is also focusing on its Ford Pro business, which continues to show strong demand and profitability.

Overall, the call highlighted Ford's commitment to navigating current challenges while positioning itself for future growth through innovation in both traditional and electric vehicle segments. The executives expressed confidence in their strategies and the potential for improved performance as they adapt to market dynamics.
