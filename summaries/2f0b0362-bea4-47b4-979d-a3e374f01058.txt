The Ford Motor Company held its 3rd Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, led by Executive Director of Investor Relations, Lynn Antipa-Tyson, and featuring key executives including CEO Jim Farley and CFO John Lawler. The call addressed the company's financial performance, challenges, and strategic direction amidst ongoing industry changes, particularly in the electric vehicle (EV) market.

Farley expressed gratitude for the Ford teamâ€™s efforts in reaching a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers, which is expected to help restart operations and bring back over 20,000 employees. He highlighted the company's focus on product strength, particularly in the Ford Blue segment, which includes popular models like the F-150 and Bronco. Despite challenges from the UAW strike and rising costs, Ford remains optimistic about its product lineup and future growth.

Lawler provided financial details, noting a mixed quarter with adjusted EBIT of $2.2 billion and a revenue increase of 11%. However, the UAW strike negatively impacted production and financial guidance for the year was withdrawn due to ongoing uncertainties. The company is also adjusting its EV strategy, focusing on cost reduction and vertical integration to improve profitability in the face of a competitive market.

Peter Stern discussed the formation of Ford Integrated Services, aimed at enhancing customer experiences through software and services, which is seen as a key growth area. The executives emphasized the importance of adapting to market dynamics, particularly in the EV sector, where pricing pressures and competition are significant.

Overall, Ford is committed to its "Ford Plus" strategy, which aims to balance growth in traditional vehicles with a strong push into EVs, while also addressing operational challenges related to quality and cost. The call concluded with a Q&A session, where executives addressed various inquiries about the company's future direction and financial outlook.
