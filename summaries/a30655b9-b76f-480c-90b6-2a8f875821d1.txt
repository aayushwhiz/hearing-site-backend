Farley expressed gratitude for the Ford team's efforts in reaching a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers, emphasizing the importance of restarting operations and supporting employees. He highlighted the company's focus on product strength, particularly in the Ford Blue segment, which includes popular models like the F-150 and Bronco.
